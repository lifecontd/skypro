Pilot for Productivity Improvement


Go-to Supervisor
Current Senario: 
1.	Over 50% of a team leader's time is spent in focused work like coachings, escalations, call monitoring and meetings. 
2.	Task switching makes team leaders inefficient in focused work and lack of real time intervention leads to mistakes by advisors. 
3.	Which result in audits like why was this call transferred and why was a sale not pitched on this call.
